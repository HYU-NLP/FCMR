ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
• The Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex includes fractionators located either in Mont Belvieu, Texas or in surrounding areas of Chambers County, Texas. This complex processes mixed NGLs from several major NGL supply basins in North America, including the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent and San Juan Basin. In addition, the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex features connectivity to our network of NGL supply and distribution pipelines, approximately 130 MMBbls of underground salt dome storage capacity, along with access to international markets through our marine terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel. Demand for NGL fractionation capacity continues to expand as producers in domestic shale plays such as the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and DJ Basin seek market access and end users require supply assurance.
In November 2018, we announced plans to construct a new NGL fractionation facility in Chambers County, Texas adjacent to our existing Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation complex. The new facility consists of two fractionation trains capable of processing a combined 300 MBPD of NGLs. The first of the two fractionation trains, referred to as “Frac X,” has a nameplate capacity of 150 MBPD and is expected to enter service in the first quarter of 2020. The second of these fractionation trains, referred to as “Frac XI,” will also have a nameplate capacity of 150 MBPD, and is scheduled to begin service in the third quarter of 2020. We will own and operate both Frac X and Frac XI. Once Frac XI enters service, total NGL fractionation capacity at our Mont Belvieu complex will approximate 1.1 MMBPD.
 • The Shoup and Armstrong NGL fractionators in South Texas process mixed NGLs supplied by regional natural gas processing facilities. Purity NGL products from the Shoup and Armstrong fractionators are transported to local markets in the Corpus Christi area and also to the Mont Belvieu hub using our South Texas NGL Pipeline System.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP report:
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
