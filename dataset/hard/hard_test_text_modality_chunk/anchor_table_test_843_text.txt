ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
• The Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) provides terminaling services to exporters, marketers, distributors, chemical companies and major integrated oil companies. EHT has extensive waterfront access consisting of seven deep-water ship docks, a barge dock and a lay berth dock. The terminal can accommodate vessels with up to a 45 foot draft, including Suezmax tankers, which are the largest tankers that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel. We believe that our location on the Houston Ship Channel enables us to handle larger vessels than our competitors because our waterfront has fewer draft and beam (width) restrictions. The size and structure of our waterfront allows us to receive and unload products for our customers and provide terminaling services.
EHT can load refrigerated cargoes of low-ethane propane and/or butane (collectively referred to as LPG) onto multiple tanker vessels simultaneously. Our LPG export services continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays, international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene production, and for power generation and heating purposes. The current estimated maximum loading capacity for LPG at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD. EHT has the capability to load up to six Very Large Gas Carrier (“VLGC”) vessels simultaneously, while maintaining the option to switch between loading propane and butane. EHT can load a single VLGC in less than 24 hours, creating greater efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. LPG loading volumes at EHT averaged 588 MBPD, 483 MBPD and 445 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The primary customer of EHT is our NGL marketing group, which uses the terminal to meet the needs of export customers. NGL marketing transacts with these customers using long-term sales contracts with take-or-pay provisions and/or exchange agreements. In recent years, the U.S. has become the largest exporter of LPG in the world, with shipments originating from EHT playing a key role.

WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
(b) Interest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly. Our senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2019 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 6.35% and will mature between 2020 and 2049. 
We expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. Our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. 
As of December 31, 2019 , we held $219 million of our $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. The 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds are needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
