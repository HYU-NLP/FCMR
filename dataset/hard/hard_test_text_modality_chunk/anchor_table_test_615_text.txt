ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
The following table presents segment gross operating margin and selected volumetric data for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment for the years indicated (dollars in millions, volumes as noted): 
Comparison of 2018 with 2017 . Gross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2018 increased $240.2 million when compared to 2017. Our PDH facility, which completed its commissioning (or start up) phase and began full commercial operations in April 2018, contributed $104.4 million of gross operating margin in 2018. Plant production volumes for the PDH facility, including by-products, averaged 20 MBPD during 2018. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters increased $91.2 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average propylene sales margins, which accounted for a $108.8 million increase, and higher average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for an additional $14.6 million increase, partially offset by lower propylene sales volumes, which accounted for a $34.6 million decrease, and higher major maintenance costs, which accounted for an additional $7.5 million decrease. Lastly, gross operating margin from our propylene pipelines increased a net $16.5 million year-to-year primarily due to expansion projects in south Louisiana being placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2017. Transportation volumes for our propylene pipelines increased an aggregate 20 MBPD year-to-year. 
Comparison of 2017 with 2016. Gross operating margin from propylene production and related marketing activities for 2017 increased a net $10.3 million when compared to 2016. Gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters increased a net $33.0 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average propylene sales margins and volumes, which accounted for $24.4 million and $19.1 million, respectively, of increases, along with higher average propylene fractionation fees, which accounted for an additional $13.8 million increase, partially offset by higher storage, major maintenance and other operating costs, which accounted for a combined $23.9 million decrease. The increase in gross operating margin from our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters was partially offset by higher commissioning costs of the PDH facility in 2017, which increased $13.3 million year-to-year.
