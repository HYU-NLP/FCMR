ABBOTT LABORATORIES report:
The net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $ 39 million in 2018 and $ 109 million in 2017. These tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to AbbVie’s operations for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), which was formed to hold Abbott’s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to AbbVie’s business. AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business.
In September 2016, Abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $ 4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The decision to sell AMO reflected Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. In February 2017, Abbott completed the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2017. Abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $ 728 million in 2017 related to the sale of AMO. The operating results of AMO up to the date of sale continued to be included in Earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. For 2017, the AMO loss before taxes included in Abbott’s consolidated earnings was $ 18 million.
Other (income) expense, net, for 2019, 2018 and 2017 includes approximately $ 225 million, $ 160 million and $ 160 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net, for 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $ 1.163 billion related to the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson. In 2017, Abbott recorded a $ 45 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. See Note 4 — Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions for further discussion of these 2017 sales.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC report:
Subsequent to our withdrawal, the CSPF incurred extensive asset losses and indicated that it was projected to become insolvent. In such event, the CSPF benefits would be reduced to the legally permitted Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") limits, triggering the coordinating benefits provision in the collective bargaining agreement. 
In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) was enacted into law. The ARPA contains provisions that allow for qualifying multiemployer pension plans to apply for special financial assistance ("SFA") from the PBGC, which will be funded by the U.S. government. Following SFA approval, a qualifying multiemployer pension plan will receive a lump sum payment to enable it to continue paying unreduced pension benefits through 2051. The multiemployer plan is not obligated to repay the SFA. The ARPA is intended to prevent both the PBGC and certain financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, including the CSPF, from becoming insolvent through 2051. The CSPF submitted an application for SFA that was approved in December 2022. In January 2023, $35.8 billion was paid to the CSPF by the PBGC. 
The passage of the ARPA triggered a remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan under ASC 715. Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and pension benefit obligation as of March 31, 2021, which resulted in an actuarial gain of $ 6.4 billion, reflecting a reduction of the liability for coordinating benefits of $ 5.1 billion and a gain from other updated actuarial assumptions of $ 1.3 billion.
