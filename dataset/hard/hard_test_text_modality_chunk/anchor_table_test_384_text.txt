ALLSTATE CORP report:
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. In addition, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binominal lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility of the price of the underlying shares is implied based on traded options and historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected dividends were based on the current dividend yield of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $17.03 , $14.60  and $12.25  during 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively. The intrinsic value, which is the difference between the fair value and the exercise price, of options exercised was $72 million , $199 million  and $119 million  during 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively.  Changes in restricted stock units 
The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant. The market value in part reflects the payment of future dividends expected. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted was $93.16 , $80.12  and $63.51  during 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested was $47 million , $58 million  and $29 million  during 2018 , 2017  and 2016 , respectively.
