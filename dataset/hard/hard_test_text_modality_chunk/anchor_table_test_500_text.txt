Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash by the partnership allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.

Content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks. Production contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments over the term of the license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. The commitments exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. We expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs. 
Other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. Some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period.

ENERGY TRANSFER LP report:
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impacts of the following: 
• an increase of $483 million in transportation margin primarily due to a $265 million increase resulting from the initiation of service on our Mariner East 2 pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $212 million increase resulting from higher throughput volumes received from the Permian region on our Texas NGL pipelines, a $29 million increase due to higher throughput volumes from the Barnett region, a $9 million increase from the Eagle Ford region, and a $9 million increase due to the initiation of service on the JC Nolan Pipeline. These increases were partially offset by a $21 million decrease resulting from Mariner East 1 pipeline downtime, a $13 million decrease due to the closure of a third-party refinery during the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting refined product supply to our system, and a $5 million decrease due to the timing of deficiency fees on Mariner West; 
• an increase of $153 million in fractionation and refinery services margin primarily due to a $167 million increase resulting from the commissioning of our fifth and sixth fractionators in July 2018 and February 2019, respectively, and higher NGL volumes from the Permian region feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility. This increase was partially offset by a reclassification between our fractionation and storage margins;
