As of December 31 , 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 1,476 , $ 2,412 and $ 1,736 , respectively, of which $ 1,287 , $ 1,405 and $ 1,568 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2019 , these amounts are primarily associated with the amount of research tax credits claimed, uncertainties in the TCJA, tax basis adjustments and the U.S. manufacturing activity tax benefit. 
Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2015. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2015-2017 federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2007-2018 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. 
Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits related to federal matters under audit may decrease by up to $ 710 based on current estimates.
