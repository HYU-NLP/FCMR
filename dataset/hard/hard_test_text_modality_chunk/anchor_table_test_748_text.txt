WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
The Company has ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. For each such entity, the Company evaluates its ownership, other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether it should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events. As part of its evaluation, the Company initially determines whether the entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). Management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a VIE including whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties, (ii) the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity’s operations, and (iii) the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses (or receive the expected returns) of the entity. If the entity is a VIE and if the Company has a variable interest in the entity, the Company uses judgment in determining if it is the primary beneficiary and is thus required to consolidate the entity. In making this determination, the Company evaluates whether it or another party involved with the VIE (1) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. 
If it is concluded that an entity is not a VIE, the Company considers its proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidates majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. A controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive third-party participation rights. Key factors considered by the Company in determining the presence of substantive third-party participation rights include, but are not limited to, control of the board of directors, budget approval or veto rights, or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming, creative development, marketing, and selection of key personnel. Ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which the Company has significant influence are accounted for as equity method.

MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
– For 2021, operating gains, favorable currency translation, fewer shares outstanding, higher equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes primarily due to a lower net benefit from non-recurring discrete tax items, drove the Adjusted EPS growth. 
– For 2020, operating gains, an increase in benefit plan non-service income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, primarily drove the Adjusted EPS growth. 
Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).

ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
• We own and operate NGL fractionators located in Chambers County, Texas. These fractionators process mixed NGLs from several major NGL supply basins in North America, including the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent and San Juan Basin. Our Chambers County NGL fractionators are connected to our network of NGL supply and distribution pipelines, approximately 130 MMBbls of underground salt dome storage capacity, along with access to international markets through our marine terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel.
In April 2022, we announced plans to construct a twelfth NGL fractionator (“Frac XII”) in Chambers County, Texas. Frac XII is expected to be capable of processing 150 MBPD of NGLs and enter service in the third quarter of 2023. Completion of this fractionator is expected to increase our total Chambers County NGL fractionation capacity to approximately 1.2 MMBPD.
 • The Shoup and Armstrong NGL fractionators in South Texas process mixed NGLs supplied by regional natural gas processing facilities. Purity NGL products from these fractionators are transported to local markets in the Corpus Christi area and also to Chambers County, Texas using our South Texas NGL Pipeline System.
