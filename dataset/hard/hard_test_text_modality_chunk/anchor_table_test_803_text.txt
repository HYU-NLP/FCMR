On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as "Swiss tax reform". Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $ 767 million, which consisted of a $ 769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $ 2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. We continue to monitor interpretative guidance on Swiss tax reform that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded. 
On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform legislation ("U.S. tax reform") was enacted that included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of businesses. We finalized our accounting for the new provisions during the fourth quarter of 2018. U.S. tax reform resulted in a total transition tax liability of $ 1.3 billion based on the deemed repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which will be paid in installments through 2026.

WORLD KINECT CORP report:
Income Taxes . For the year ended 2017 , our effective income tax rate was (707.1)% and our income tax provision was $149.2 million , as compared to an effective income tax rate of 11.0% and an income tax provision of $15.7 million in 2016 . The higher effective income tax rate for 2017 , as compared to 2016 , resulted principally from the effects of the Tax Act's $143.7 million one-time transition tax on historical accumulated foreign earnings. Without the one-time tax charge, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been (25.9)%. 
Net Loss and Diluted Earnings per Common Share . Our net loss for the year ended 2017 was $170.2 million as compared to net income of $126.5 million in 2016. Diluted loss per common share for the year ended 2017 was $2.50 per common share as compared to diluted earnings per common share of $1.81 in 2016. 
Our liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Credit Facility, fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our suppliers, as well as changes in fuel prices. Availability under our Credit Facility is also limited by, among other things, our financial leverage ratio, which limits the total amount of indebtedness we may incur, and may, therefore, fluctuate from period to period.

ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
With respect to our isomerization operations, we compete primarily with facilities located in Kansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Competitive factors affecting this business include the level of toll processing fees charged, the quality of isobutane that can be produced and access to supporting pipeline and storage infrastructure. We compete with other octane additive manufacturing companies primarily on the basis of price.
With respect to our TE Products Pipeline, the pipeline’s most significant competitors are third-party pipelines in the areas where it delivers products. Competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation fees, quality of customer service and proximity to end users. Trucks, barges and railroads competitively deliver products into some of the markets served by our TE Products Pipeline and river terminals. The TE Products Pipeline also faces competition from rail and pipeline movements of NGLs from Canada and waterborne imports into terminals located along the upper East Coast.
Our marine transportation business competes with other inland marine transportation companies as well as providers of other modes of transportation, such as rail tank cars, tractor-trailer tank trucks and, to a limited extent, pipelines. Competition within the marine transportation business is largely based on performance and price. Also, substantial new construction of inland marine vessels could create an oversupply and intensify competition for our marine transportation business.
