WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
The balances as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 included $ 375 million , $ 378 million and $ 189 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s income tax expense and effective tax rate after giving effect to interest deductions and offsetting benefits from other tax jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , decreases in unrecognized tax benefits related to multiple audit resolutions and the lapse of statutes of limitations were offset by the uncertainty of allocation and taxation of income among multiple jurisdictions. 
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service recently completed audit procedures for its 2008 to 2011 tax years, the results of which should be finalized in the coming year. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for its 2012 to 2015 consolidated federal income tax returns. It is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter. Accordingly, an estimate of any related impact to the reserve for uncertain tax positions cannot currently be determined. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audit by any jurisdiction for years prior to 2006 . Adjustments that arose from the completion of audi ts for certain tax years have been included in the change in uncertain tax positions in the table above. 
It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company's uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $ 128 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, foreign judicial proceedings, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments.
