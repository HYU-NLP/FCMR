ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
Gross operating margin from our EFS Midstream System decreased a net $108 million year-to-year primarily due to lower deficiency revenues as a result of the expiration of minimum volume commitments under certain long-term gathering agreements, which accounted for a $133 million decrease, partially offset by higher average transportation fees, which accounted for an $8 million increase. Our EFS Midstream System will continue to transport volumes produced on dedicated acreage through the remaining term of these agreements, most of which have a life-of-lease duration.
Gross operating margin from our equity investment in the Seaway Pipeline decreased $70 million year-to-year primarily due to lower average transportation fees, which accounted for a $ 39 million decrease, a $16 million decrease due to LaaR payments from power service providers in connection with the February 2021 winter storms, and higher utility and other operating costs, which accounted for an additional $7 million decrease. Transportation volumes on our Seaway Pipeline increased 40 MBPD year-to-year (net to our interest).
Gross operating margin from crude oil activities at EHT decreased $20 million year-to-year primarily due to lower storage and other revenues, which accounted for a $12 million decrease, and higher operating costs, which accounted for an additional $5 million decrease.
