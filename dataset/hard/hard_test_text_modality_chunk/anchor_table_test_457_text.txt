UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC report:
We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018  (in millions): 
Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. Capital leases, operating leases and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in note 8  to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2018 . The calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. For debt denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments. 
Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets, goods or services that are legally binding, including contracts for aircraft, construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles. As of December 31, 2018 , we had firm commitments to purchase 19 new Boeing 747-8F cargo aircraft to be delivered between 2019 and 2022 and nine Boeing 767 aircraft to be delivered between 2019 and 2020.
