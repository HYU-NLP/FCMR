ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
The results of operations from our NGL fractionation business are generally dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated and either (i) the level of fractionation fees charged (under fee-based contracts) or (ii) the value of NGLs received (under percent-of-liquids arrangements). Under fee-based fractionation contracts, customers retain title to the NGLs that we process for them. Under percent-of-liquids fractionation contracts, we retain a portion of the purity NGLs we separate for customers and are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations in NGL prices. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the use of commodity derivative instruments.
The approximate net plant capacity does not necessarily correspond to our ownership interest in each facility. The capacity is based on a variety of factors such as the level of volumes an owner processes at the facility and contractual arrangements with joint owners.
On a weighted-average basis, the overall utilization rates for our NGL fractionators (based on nameplate capacities) were 100.0%, 93.8% and 101.6% during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
