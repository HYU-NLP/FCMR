MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
• We evaluated the realizability of our assets and whether there are any impairment indicators. We reviewed our receivables, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, equity method and other long-term investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets. 
• In connection with the ongoing pandemic, we identified a decline in demand for certain of our brands, primarily in the gum category, that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinite-life intangible assets during the second quarter of 2020 in addition to our annual testing in the third quarter of 2020. In connection with the testing, we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded $144 million of impairment charges in 2020. While we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands, there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. If brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation. 
While some of the initial impacts of the pandemic on our business moderated in the second half of 2020, the business and economic environment remains uncertain and additional impacts may arise that we cannot currently anticipate. Barring material business disruptions or other negative developments, we expect to continue to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks, food and beverage products. However, the elevated consumer demand we experienced primarily in some of our developed market countries in 2020 may not continue. We are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last or how significant it will be. We expect the COVID-19 outbreak to result in lower revenues primarily in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets (such as small family-run stores), our gum and candy categories (which are more instant consumption in nature), as well as our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores) and foodservice businesses. As we continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic, we continue to communicate with and support our employees and customers; monitor and take steps to further safeguard our supply chain, operations, technology and assets; protect our liquidity and financial position; work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance as we seek to position the Company to withstand the current uncertainty related to this pandemic.

ENERGY TRANSFER LP report:
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to the Investment in Sunoco LP segment increased due to the net impacts of the following: 
• an increase in the gross profit on motor fuel sales of $32 million, primarily due to a 18% increase in gross profit per gallon sold and the receipt of a $13 million make-up payment under Sunoco LP’s fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc., partially offset by a 13% decrease in gallons sold; and 
• a decrease of $54 million in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense, primarily attributable to lower employee costs, maintenance, advertising, credit card fees and utilities, which was partially offset by a $12 million charge for current expected credit losses on Sunoco LP’s accounts receivable in connection with the financial impact from COVID-19; and
