WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
The above table does not include certain long-term obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted. For example, as of December 31, 2018 , we have recorded $415 million  for redeemable equity (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), although we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. The current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $23 million  as of December 31, 2018 . Additionally, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $378 million  as of December 31, 2018 . 
The above table also does not include DCL's revolving credit facility that, during the year ended December 31, 2018 , allowed DCL and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of DCL to borrow up to $2.5 billion , including a $100 million  sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $50 million  sublimit for swingline loans. Borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program discussed below. As of December 31, 2018 , the revolving credit facility agreement provided for a maturity date of August 11, 2022  and the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. 
From time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of December 31, 2018  based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of all available cash, after any cash reserves established by Enterprise GP in its sole discretion. Cash reserves include those for the proper conduct of our business, including those for capital investments, debt service, working capital, operating expenses, common unit repurchases, commitments and contingencies and other amounts. The retention of cash allows us to reinvest in our growth and reduce our future reliance on the equity and debt capital markets.

MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
For the periods presented, we measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along a yield curve used to measure plan obligations to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
