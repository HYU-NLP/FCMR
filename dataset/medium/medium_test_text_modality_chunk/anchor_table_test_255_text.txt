BOEING CO report:
Given the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and T-7A Red Hawk contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience. 
We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts and observed the work site to evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. 
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing the estimates. We developed independent expectations of likely outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates.

BUNGE GLOBAL SA report:
Segment EBIT decreased by $619 million primarily driven by our grain origination business, which was impacted by weaker margins, primarily due to slow farmer selling, strong competition and logistics commitments in South America and weaker results in our soybean processing facilities in most regions. Also, contributing to lower EBIT were severance, employee benefit and other program costs related to our Global Competitiveness Program (“GCP”), impairment charges, transaction costs related to the acquisition of two oilseed crushing facilities in Western Europe and the increase of general and administrative expenses for recent acquisitions. 
Edible Oil Products Segment — Edible oil products segment net sales increased by 17% in 2017 to $8.0 billion, compared to $6.9 billion in 2016, resulting primarily from an 11% increase in volumes, driven by our acquisitions of two edible oil production facilities in Europe, the recent acquisition of an edible oil production facility in Argentina and increased volumes in Asia-Pacific and Brazil. 
Cost of goods sold in 2017 increased 17% compared to 2016, which is in line with the increase in net sales noted above, and primarily driven by the impact of the recent acquisitions in Europe and Argentina and increased volumes in Asia-Pacific and Brazil compared to 2016. Additionally, 2017 included $6 million of severance and employee benefit costs related to industrial productivity initiatives.
