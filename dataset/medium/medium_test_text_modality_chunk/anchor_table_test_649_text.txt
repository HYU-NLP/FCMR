VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC report:
In addition, we issue asset-backed debt secured by our device payment plan agreement receivables and the collections on such receivables. These transactions require us to comply with various tests, including delinquency and loss-related tests, which, if not met, would cause the asset-backed debt to amortize earlier and faster than otherwise expected. The holders of our asset-backed debt do not have any recourse to Verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. However, if an early amortization of our asset-backed debt occurs, including as a result of increased customer delinquencies or losses relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, all collections on the securitized device payment plan agreement receivables would be used to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed debt, and our financing cash flow requirements would increase for the twelve months immediately following an early amortization event. 
Our revenues and expenses in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the actions we took to care for our employees and to keep our customers connected and as a result of our customersâ€™ changing activities as well as the restrictions on activities and the global economic slowdown, as describe d below. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 2020 results was primarily a result of decreases in wireless service revenue, wireless equipment revenue and advertising and search revenue at Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media), and the operational actions we took, as described above. 
The year ended December 31, 2020 included lower overage revenues and lower fees from activations and upgrades and fewer fees, as well as lower roaming revenues as our customers significantly reduced travel during the year. As a result of our decision to keep our customers connected during the crisis, we experienced fewer step ups in data plans in the first half of 2020. We saw the rate of step ups increase during the second half of 2020. During the first half of 2020, we also saw a reduction in advertising and search revenue in Verizon Media, as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns. This reduction moderated during the third quarter of 2020 and turned to revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2020.
