ABBOTT LABORATORIES report:
In 2020, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment decreased 19.4 percent. The operating margin profile decreased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 25.8 percent in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes as a result of the pandemic and pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 
In Abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business, sales increased 40.6 percent in 2020 and 5.9 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2020 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms, partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic. Growth in 2019 reflected continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the U.S. and internationally. The 2019 growth included the continued adoption by customers of Alinity, which is Abbott’s integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results.
Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” instrument for hematology in Europe and Japan. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for the “Alinity s” (blood screening) and “Alinity m” (molecular) instruments and several testing assays.
