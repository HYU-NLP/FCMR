BOEING CO report:
We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. The stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested as of December 31, 2017. 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 90 , $ 279 and $ 320 , with a related tax benefit of $ 32 , $ 61 and $ 70 , respectively. No options vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. 
In February 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted to our executives 325,108 , 233,582 and 260,730 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $ 319.04 , $ 428.22 and $ 361.13 per unit, respectively. In December 2020, we granted to our executives 721,734 RSUs as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of $ 233.00 per unit. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period, except in the case of the December 2020 grant, which will vest in full for executives that terminate employment due to retirement after attaining certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. These RSUs are labeled executive long-term incentive program in the table below.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP report:
The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is primarily responsible for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing discretion. 
The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $ 1,851 and $ 1,711 , respectively. 
In most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000 per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net reduction in sales was $ 1,707 , $ 1,537 , and $ 1,394 respectively.

ALLSTATE CORP report:
Accrual and disclosure policy The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management’s best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not establish accruals for such matters when the Company does not believe both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals.

The Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings for further developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and estimable, and accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount of accruals that have been previously established. There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of any amount accrued. Disclosure of the nature and amount of an accrual is made when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the amount of accrual. 
When the Company assesses it is reasonably possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it discloses the matter. When it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that
