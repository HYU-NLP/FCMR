BOEING CO report:
• We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate management’s ability to achieve the key cost and schedule estimates, as well as evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project. 
• We tested the accuracy and completeness of the key data used in developing estimates. We developed independent expectations of reasonable outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates. 
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop key estimates, including controls over the key data used in developing the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.
