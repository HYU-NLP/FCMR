SALESFORCE INC report:
We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. The increase  in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. 
Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent  during fiscal year 2019 and 2018 . 
Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $3.8 billion , or 29 percent  of total revenues, for fiscal 2019 , compared to $2.9 billion , or 28 percent  of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $0.9 billion , or 31 percent . The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis by $39 million  in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling.

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC report:
As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling approximately $ 677 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. 
During 2020, Verizon entered into 12 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur in 2021 through 2023, as applicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities. 
We have various commitments, totaling $ 24.6 billion, primarily to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $ 8.2 billion is attributable to 2021, $ 10.8 billion is attributable to 2022 through 2023, $ 4.1 billion is attributable to 2024 through 2025 and $ 1.5 billion is attributable to years thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancellable quantities or termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments totaled approximately $ 10.5 billion for 2020, $ 10.9 billion for 2019 and $ 9.0 billion for 2018. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2020, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.
