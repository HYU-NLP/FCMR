ALLSTATE CORP report:
Fixed income securities include bonds and asset-backed securities (“ABS”). Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to their contractual maturity, are designated as available-for-sale (“AFS”) and are carried at fair value. The difference between amortized cost, net of credit loss allowances (“amortized cost, net”) and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its AFS fixed income securities. Cash received from calls and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Equity securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments. Certain exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income securities as their underlying investments. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Equity securities without readily determinable or estimable fair values are measured using the measurement alternative, which is cost less impairment, if any, and adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. 
Mortgage loans and bank loans are carried at amortized cost, net, which represent the amount expected to be collected. The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its mortgage and bank loans. Credit loss allowances are estimates of expected credit losses, established for loans upon origination or purchase, and are established considering all relevant information available, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the life of the loans. Loans are evaluated on a pooled basis when they share similar risk characteristics; otherwise, they are evaluated individually.

BOEING CO report:
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 737 program: deferred production costs of $ 1,296 and $ 2,159 and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $ 617 and $ 480 . At December 31, 2021, $ 1,906 of 737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders, and $ 7 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. 
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $ 3,363 and $ 1,727 of work in process and $ 3,521 and $ 3,295 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus costs already included in 777X inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $ 6,493 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs. As a result, 777X deferred production costs were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and remain immaterial at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, any contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.
