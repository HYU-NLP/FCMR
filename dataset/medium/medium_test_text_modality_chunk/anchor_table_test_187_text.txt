ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline originates at our Midland terminal and extends 444 miles to our Sealy terminal, with crude oil volumes arriving at Sealy transported to our ECHO terminal using the Rancho II pipeline. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline was created by converting the Midland-to-Sealy segment of one of our two Seminole NGL pipelines from NGL service to crude oil service. We retain the flexibility to convert this pipeline back to NGL service should future market conditions support the need for additional NGL transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. The Midland-to-ECHO 2 Pipeline has an approximate maximum transportation capacity of up to 225 MBPD, depending on certain operational variables.
The Midland-to-ECHO 3 Pipeline is comprised of a 36-inch pipeline extending from Midland, Texas to our ECHO terminal, and further from ECHO to a third-party terminal in Webster, Texas (collectively, the “Midland-to-Webster pipeline”). The maximum transportation capacity on the Midland-to-Webster pipeline is approximately 450 MBPD.
 • The Seaway Pipeline connects the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil hub with markets in southeast Texas. The Seaway Pipeline is comprised of the Longhaul System, the Freeport System and the Texas City System. The Cushing hub is an industry trading hub and price settlement point for WTI crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”).

The discussion below is on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger. 
Advertising revenue decreased 5% in 2022, primarily attributable to declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, partially offset by higher sports advertising in the U.S. due to the NCAA Men's Final Four and Championship games airing on our networks and the addition of the NHL starting in the fourth quarter of 2021.
