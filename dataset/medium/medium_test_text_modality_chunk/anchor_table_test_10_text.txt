MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
On April 1, 2020, we acquired a majority interest in Give & Go, a North American leader in fully-finished sweet baked goods and owner of the famous two-bite ® brand of brownies and the Create-A-Treat ® brand, known for cookie and gingerbread house decorating kits. The acquisition of Give & Go provides access to the in-store bakery channel and expands our position in broader snacking. The purchase consideration for Give & Go totaled $ 1,136 million, net of cash received. We have recorded a purchase price allocation of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: 
Within definite-life intangible assets, we allocated $ 416 million to customer relationships which have an estimated useful life of 17 years. Goodwill arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across both new and legacy product categories. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
The fair value for customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements of intangible assets are based on significant unobservable inputs, and thus represent Level 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of intangible assets include discounted future cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates. Through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $ 106 million and operating income of $ 6 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $ 15 million in 2020. We incurred acquisition integration costs of $ 6 million in 2021 and $ 2 million in 2020.
