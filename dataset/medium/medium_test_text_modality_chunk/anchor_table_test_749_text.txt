McDonnell Douglas Corporation insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value was $ 374 and $ 395 and the total loans were $ 360 and $ 382 . As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
We have recorded earnings charges for losses on a number of fixed-price development contracts. Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger additional earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

Net investment income decreased 27.0% or $890 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower performance-based results, mainly from limited partnerships, partially offset by higher market-based fixed income portfolio yields. We expect market-based net investment income to increase as we continue to reinvest at market yields that are above the current market-based portfolio yield.
