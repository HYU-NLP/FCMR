SALESFORCE INC report:
We offer our employees various talent development programs to create a culture of continuous learning. Learning and development opportunities include Trailhead, our learning platform available for all employees, in-person and virtual classes, guides and workbooks and more. We also encourage our employees to seek personal and professional development opportunities with external organizations and offer yearly education reimbursement to employees who wish to continue job-related education from accredited institutions or organizations. For example, over 7,600 employees participated in at least one of our professional development training programs in fiscal 2022. 
We believe offering competitive compensation packages and robust benefits is an important factor in our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees and to help enhance their everyday wellbeing. We use a combination of fixed and variable cash compensation for all employees and award equity compensation to certain employees in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units. Eligible employees are also able to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a 15 percent discount up to U.S. Internal Revenue Code limits. We also match up to $5,000 of donations, per employee, to eligible nonprofit organizations. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. 
Alignment and consistent and clear communication are a key part of our employee engagement, especially as we continue to grow. Each year, we complete a corporate V2MOM, which is an internal management tool used to align the Company on our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures for the upcoming year. All employees are then expected to complete their own V2MOM that aligns with the corporate V2MOM. In addition, our Code of Conduct ensures that our core values remain the foundation of the Company and directly impact our ability to deliver success. We expect all of our employees to commit to acting with integrity and treating others with compassion and respect.

BOEING CO report:
Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are fully cooperating with all ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these lawsuits, investigations, and inquiries. We have also experienced claims and/or assertions from customers and suppliers in connection with the grounding. As a result of the grounding, we reduced the 737 production rate from 52 per month to 42 per month in 2019 and in December 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 production beginning in January 2020. We have concluded that the suspension of production and the gradual resumption of production at low production rates will result in abnormal production costs which will be expensed when incurred rather than inventoried. Prior to the grounding, we had planned to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019. 
In the preparation of our financial statements, we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing and conditions of return to service, the duration of the 737 MAX production suspension and timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production rate changes, timing and sequence of future customer deliveries as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers impacted by the grounding. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those costs that should be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time, they are highly uncertain and significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements. 
The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed that regulatory approval of the 737 MAX will enable deliveries to resume during mid-2020. We have also assumed that, as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737 MAX pilots to undergo computer and simulator training. We have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood, and then we expect to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years. We are also assuming that 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them delivering during the first year after the resumption of deliveries. The cumulative impacts of changes to assumptions regarding timing of return to service and timing of planned production rates have increased the estimated costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity by approximately $6.3 billion, which will be recorded in program inventory. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and lower production rates is expected to result in approximately $4.0 billion of abnormal production costs in 2020 and 2021 that will be expensed as incurred. The increases in the estimated costs accounted for as program inventory will reduce 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins in future periods after deliveries resume. Production costs incurred while production is suspended and a portion of production costs incurred while we gradually increase production rates to a normal level will be expensed as incurred as abnormal costs and will not be included in program inventory. We may face additional costs, delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX and/or the resumption of deliveries, and/or further delays in planned production rate increases which may result in further increases in program costs and/or abnormal production costs.
