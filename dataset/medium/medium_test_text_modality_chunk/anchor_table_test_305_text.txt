BOEING CO report:
In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $ 440 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis adjustment). 
The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and GILTI liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 .
