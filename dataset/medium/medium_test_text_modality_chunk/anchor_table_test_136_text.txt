BOEING CO report:
Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended December 31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: 
Investments, Acquired intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. 
For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018 , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.
