ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
In December 2014, Seaway submitted an application requesting market-based rate setting authority. Certain parties filed protests to the application. In September 2015, the FERC issued an order setting the matter for hearing. In December 2016, an administrative law judge issued an initial decision in the market-based rate proceeding (“2016 Initial Decision”) finding that the FERC should grant Seaway’s application for market-based rates. In May 2018, the FERC issued an order affirming the initial decision’s finding that Seaway lacks market power in the applicable markets, thereby granting Seaway market-based rate authority.
In March 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on the Treatment of Income Taxes (the “Revised Policy”). The Revised Policy reversed a 13-year old policy that permitted a pipeline owned by a master limited partnership (“MLP”) to recover an income tax allowance (“ITA”) in its cost-of-service rates, if it could demonstrate that the ultimate owners of the pipeline (i.e., the unitholders of the MLP) have an actual or potential income tax liability. In July 2018, the FERC, in an Order on Rehearing, decided to provide pipeline MLPs the opportunity to argue for inclusion of an ITA in cost-of-service rates on a case-by-case basis, as opposed to having no opportunity to recover an ITA. The D.C. Circuit upheld the Revised Policy and Order on Rehearing to a MLP pipeline on July 31, 2020 following court challenges initiated in September 2018.
The Revised Policy and Order on Rehearing do not impact oil and liquids pipelines with market-based rate authority, or those that charge “settlement rates,” and have no immediate effect on crude oil and liquid pipelines with rates set using the indexing methodology, given that the current index will remain in effect through June 30, 2021. Following issuance of the Revised Policy, the FERC now requires crude oil and liquids pipelines owned by MLPs to remove the ITA from their cost-of-service reporting in FERC Form No. 6. In its final rule issued December 17, 2020, the FERC removed any effect of the change in ITA treatment in determining the index for rates that will take effect on July 1, 2021.
