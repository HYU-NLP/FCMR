ABBOTT LABORATORIES report:
Growth in Structural Heart, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was 13.0 percent in 2022, driven by growth across several areas of the busin ess, including Amplatzer® Amulet® Left Atrial Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form and MitraClip®, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve. In Vascular, 2022 sales decreased 1.0 percent, excluding the impact of exchange, as higher endovascular sales were offset by the negative effect of lower average selling prices globally on traditional DES and other coronary products and a lower recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures which impacted the coronary business. 
In 2021, while procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in the year by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., overall volumes improved over the course of 2021 across various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in Structural Heart during 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip and TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve. 
Abbott’s operations in Russia and Ukraine represent approximately 2 percent of Abbott’s total revenues and net assets, and to date the financial impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not been material to Abbott’s operations or financial condition. Future implications are difficult to predict, but at present Abbott does not anticipate that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. A more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
