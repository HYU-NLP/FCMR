COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP report:
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ABBOTT LABORATORIES report:
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020. Adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization.
The new lease accounting standard did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019.
