ABBOTT LABORATORIES report:
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales decreased 27.4 percent in 2022 and 2.9 percent in 2021, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In both years, the decreases were driven by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based PCR molecular tests for COVID-19, partially offset by growth in other areas from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform . Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $411 million in 2022, $891 million in 2021, and $1.0 billion in 2020. In 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 9.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 13.8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 29.2 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 27.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. 
Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 8.1 percent in 2022 and 19.4 percent in 2021. In 2022 and 2021, the increase was driven by growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. The 2022 and 2021 growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $4.3 billion in 2022, which reflected a 22.4 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2021. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.7 billion in 2021, which reflected a 36.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2020 when sales totaled $2.6 billion. 
In 2022, while procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted by new surges of COVID-19 in various geographies as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China and healthcare staffing challenges throughout the year, overall volumes improved in several businesses versus 2021. I n Electrophysiology, the 7.3 percent growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the increase in procedure volumes and the continued roll‑out of Abbott’s EnSite X EP System with EnSite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe.
