BOEING CO report:
In 2019, following two fatal 737 MAX accidents, the FAA and non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued orders suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft (the “737 MAX Grounding”). Deliveries resumed in the U.S. in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order. 
During 2019, the Company recorded an initial liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind consideration it intends to provide to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX Grounding and associated delivery delays. This liability totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and is reflected in the financial statements in Accrued liabilities. Of the $2.9 billion, $2.2 billion has been contractually agreed to with customers. The liability represents the Company’s best estimate of future concessions and other consideration to its customers. To the extent not contractually agreed upon, the estimate is based on individual negotiations with customers and the substance of such negotiations. 
The subjectivity of the estimate of approximately $0.7 billion relating to consideration that has not yet been contractually agreed to with customers involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.
