ALLSTATE CORP report:
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. The Company’s assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually giving consideration to appropriate financial data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, forward-looking expected returns for the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. Given the long-term forward looking nature of this assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not immediately result in a change. In giving consideration to the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company evaluated returns using the same sources it has used historically which include: historical average asset class returns from an independent nationally recognized vendor of this type of data blended together using the asset allocation policy weights for the Company’s pension plans; asset class return forecasts from a large global independent asset management firm that specializes in providing multi-asset class investment fund products which were blended together using the asset allocation policy weights; and expected portfolio returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a widely recognized external investment consulting firm that performs asset allocation and actuarial services for corporate pension plan sponsors. This same methodology has been applied on a consistent basis 
each year. All of these were consistent with the Company’s weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.32%  used for 2018  and 7.33%  that will be used for 2019 . The assumption for the primary qualified employee plan is 7.75%  and the employee-agent plan is 5.75%  for both years. The employee-agent plan assumption is lower than the primary qualified employee plan assumption due to a lower investment allocation to equity securities and a higher allocation to fixed income securities. As of the 2018  measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 10  and 5 years was 9.0%  and 6.6% , respectively. 
Cash flows   There was no required cash contribution necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirement under the Internal Revenue Code for the tax qualified pension plans as of December 31, 2018 . The Company currently plans to contribute $26 million  to its unfunded non-qualified plans and zero  to its qualified funded pension plans in 2019 .

SALESFORCE INC report:
In December 2018, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service, included claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors' compensation. Subsequently, three  similar shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The cases have been consolidated under the caption In re Salesforce.com, Inc. Derivative Litigation . The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Company’s people, technology and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. 
The Company’s Chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Company’s Chairman holds one  of the three  Foundation board seats. The Company’s Chairman, one  of the Company’s employees and one  of the Company’s board members hold three  of Salesforce.org’s nine  board seats. The Company does not control the Foundation’s or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results.
