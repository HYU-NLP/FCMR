VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC report:
During 2021, our net cash provided by financing activities of $8.3 billion was primarily driven by $41.4 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $8.4 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. These cash flows provided by financing activities were partially offset by $18.9 billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $10.4 billion used for dividend payments and $3.8 billion used for other financing activities. 
At December 31, 2021, our total debt was $150.9 billion, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective interest rate was 3.6%. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
At December 31, 2021, approximately $33.5 billion, or 22.2%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

SALESFORCE INC report:
As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the Company changed its international corporate structure in the year ended January 31, 2021, which included the transfer of certain intangible property to Ireland resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. The determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management. The estimated fair value serves as the tax basis of the deferred tax asset. 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s development of the assumptions used in the valuation models applied in determining the fair value of the intangible property. 
To test the estimated fair value of the intangible property, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the significant assumptions used in the valuation models, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the assumptions and estimates. We compared the more sensitive significant assumptions used by management to current industry and competitor data and the Company’s own historical results. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s own forecasts. In addition, we involved our valuation specialists and tax professionals to assist in our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and the significant assumptions underlying the fair value estimates.
