Indemnifications to ULA During the first quarter of 2020, the USAF and ULA reached a settlement regarding previously questioned deferred support and deferred production costs. As part of the settlement the USAF agreed to reimburse ULA for $ 307 of those costs, which was received by ULA in the second quarter. Our indemnification to ULA associated with the recoverability of contributed assets 
Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 13.

BUNGE GLOBAL SA report:
• Accountability —We aim to be an accountable leader within our industry, helping to raise the bar on our sector’s performance by regularly tracking and disclosing progress on our commitments and sustainability performance. Our accountability pillar includes Bunge’s review and oversight of human capital management, diversity, equity and inclusion, corporate contributions, volunteerism, and others. 
In 2021, Bunge began implementing enhancements to its enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework by incorporating more detailed sustainability risks and opportunities into the ERM process. These include risks emanating from changing climate and weather patterns, water scarcity, deforestation, human rights, farmer productivity, and increasing taxation and regulation on GHG emissions. This process was further enhanced in 2022 by adding risk factors into the ERM framework. The ERM process provides Bunge with greater oversight and management of climate-related risks and the potential financial implications, and will help ensure continued short-, medium- and long-term resilience. 
Climate risks are overseen at the Board of Directors level by the ERMC, which has responsibility for supervising the quality and integrity of our risk management practices. Enterprise risk management is overseen at the executive level by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports to our CEO, with input from relevant teams and functions.
