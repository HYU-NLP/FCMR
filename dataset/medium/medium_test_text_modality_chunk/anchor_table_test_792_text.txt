ALLSTATE CORP report:
Amortization of DAC increased 11.0% or $16 million in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily due to DAC amortization related to the non-renewal of a large underperforming account and an unfavorable adjustment associated with our annual review of assumptions. 
Our annual comprehensive review of assumptions underlying estimated future gross profits for our interest-sensitive life contracts resulted in an acceleration of DAC amortization (decrease to income) of $2 million in 2019 compared to a deceleration of DAC amortization (increase to income) of $4 million in 2018. 
Represents the change in the DAC adjustment for unrealized capital gains and losses. The DAC adjustment represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains and losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.
