VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC report:
During 2021, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $ 609 million primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media. The $ 1.6 billion valuation allowance at December 31, 2021, is primarily related to state and foreign net operating losses and credits. 
Included in the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is $ 2.8 billion, $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.4 billion, respectively, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate. 
The increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to the acquisition of Tracfone, and was partially offset by the resolution of issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving tax years 2013-2014 as well as lapses of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. The uncertain tax benefits related to the acquisition of Tracfone involve pre-acquisition tax matters and are the subject of an indemnity from América Móvil for which a corresponding indemnity asset has been established.

• Higher gross claim frequency in all coverages, as miles driven has rebounded toward pre-pandemic levels. While total frequency increased relative to the prior year, it remains below pre-pandemic levels 
• Increased severity for most coverages, driven by inflationary pressures in both physical damage and bodily injury claims. As loss cost pressure continued throughout 2022, our estimates of the year-to-date report year incurred claim severity variance to prior full year increased, partially reflecting higher losses from claims in prior quarters than initially expected
