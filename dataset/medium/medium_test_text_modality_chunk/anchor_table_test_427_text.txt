BUNGE GLOBAL SA report:
At December 31, 2018 , we had 6,899,683   4.875%  cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $690 million . Each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100 , which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends. The convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend of $4.875  per share payable quarterly. As a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on Bunge Limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible, at the holder's option, at any time into 1.1918  Bunge Limited common shares, based on the conversion price of $83.9096  per share, subject to certain additional anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 8,223,042  Bunge Limited common shares at December 31, 2018 ). At any time, if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds 130%  of the conversion price for 20  trading days during any consecutive 30  trading days (including the last trading day of such period), we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into Bunge Limited common shares at the then-prevailing conversion price. The convertible perpetual preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time. 
Our cash flows from operations vary depending on, among other items, the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our Agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and fund daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to the purchase and sale of our inventories. 
Cash used for operating activities was $1,264 million  for the year ended December 31, 2018  compared to cash used for operating activities of $1,975 million  for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Net cash outflows from operating activities was lower for the year ended December 31, 2018 , primarily due to the lower use of cash associated with beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables and higher net income during 2018, partially offset by the increased working capital requirements compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . Cash provided by (used for) operating activities for all periods presented reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force), which changed the presentation of cash flows in relation to our trade receivables securitization program. Particularly impacted are the cash receipts from payments on the deferred purchase price, which are now classified as cash inflows from investing activities, whereas previously they were classified as inflows from operating activities.
