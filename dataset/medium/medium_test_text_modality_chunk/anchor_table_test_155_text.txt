On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $ 767 million, which consisted of a $ 769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $ 2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures ), we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in 2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.

WORLD KINECT CORP report:
Our aviation segment has benefited from growth in our fuel and related services offerings, as well as our improving logistics capability and the geographic expansion of our aviation fueling operations into additional international airport locations. However, the global travel restrictions and sharp decrease in demand for air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the overall aviation market, and accordingly, our results of operations throughout 2020 and 2021. We have experienced improvements in demand and related volume increases in certain regions, principally North America, and are experiencing an accelerating recovery in Western Europe. The continued recovery in demand will be highly contingent on the timing and extent of governmental actions or restrictions globally in response to any increases in infection rates and the overall recovery of the global economy and passenger travel generally. 
In addition, our aviation segment has historically benefited from significant sales to government customers, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ("NATO") in Afghanistan, which accounted for a material portion of our aviation segment's profitability in recent years. The level of troop deployments and military-related activities can cause our government customer sales to vary significantly and materially impact our operating results. Specifically, in 2020 the U.S. government and NATO began to significantly reduce the level of troops in Afghanistan and we experienced a corresponding material decline in demand as a result. The final withdrawal of troops in the area was completed during the third quarter of 2021. 
We believe our land segment is well positioned to continue growing market share, both organically and through leveraging the capabilities of our acquisitions, serving to further enhance our commercial and industrial platforms to deliver value-added solutions to customers across the U.S. In addition, to participate in accelerating the energy transition, we continue to focus on the expansion of our sustainability offerings, which include consulting, renewable fuel products, and carbon management and renewable energy solutions through World Kinect, our global energy management brand. Our land segment can be impacted by market and weather conditions. In periods where we experience historically extreme or unseasonable weather conditions, demand for our products may be affected. In addition, our land segment also similarly benefited from sales to NATO in Afghanistan in recent years, however, such activity materially declined and ultimately concluded in 2021 in connection with the U.S. and NATO troop withdrawal.

ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities increased a net $71 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins, which accounted for a $ 135 million increase, and an increase in sales volumes, which accounted for an additional $ 29 million increase, partially offset by lower non-cash, mark-to-market earnings, which accounted for a $ 98 million decrease . The year-to-year increase in gross operating margin can be primarily attributed to results from marketing strategies that seek to optimize our storage, plant and transportation assets.
Gross operating margin for our Eastern ethane pipelines, which include our ATEX and Aegis pipelines, increased a combined $ 106 million year-to-year   primarily due to a 21 MBPD increase in transportation volumes on the ATEX Pipeline, which accounted for a $ 60 million increase, and higher deficiency fees, which accounted for an additional $ 39 million increase. 
Gross operating margin at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal increased $53 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average loading fees, which accounted for a $ 44 million increase, and an 11   MBPD increase in export volumes, which accounted for an additional $ 11 million increase.
