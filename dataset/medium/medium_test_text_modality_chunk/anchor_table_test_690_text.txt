ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
Mark-to-market earnings attributable to the Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline are associated with the hedging of crude oil market price differentials (basis spreads) between the Midland and Houston markets based on the pipeline’s capacity available to us during the hedged periods. These hedges served to lock in a positive per barrel margin on our anticipated purchases of crude oil at Midland and subsequent anticipated sales to customers in the Houston area. The mark-to-market loss in 2018 of $44.6 million reflected an increase in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets to an average of $8.48 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $2.76 per barrel through 2020 (as of December 31, 2018). The mark-to-market gain in 2019 of $88.4 million reflected a decrease in the basis spread between the Midland and Houston markets since December 31, 2018 to an average of $1.81 per barrel through 2020 relative to our average hedged amount of $1.95 per barrel through 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were a limited number of these hedges outstanding. For information regarding our commodity hedging activities, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.
Gross operating margin from other crude oil marketing activities increased a net $58.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average sales margins. These marketing activities benefitted from higher market price differentials for crude oil between the Permian Basin region, Cushing hub and Gulf Coast markets.
Gross operating margin from our West Texas System and equity investment in the Eagle Ford Crude Oil Pipeline System increased a combined $82.6 million year-to-year primarily due to higher transportation volumes of 64 MBPD (net to our interest). Gross operating margin from our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System increased $17.5 million year-to-year primarily due to higher deficiency fees. Transportation volumes on the South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System decreased 15 MBPD year-to-year.

WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
• If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met, the impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference. 
Significant judgments used for long-lived asset impairment assessments include identifying the appropriate asset groupings and primary assets within those groupings, determining whether events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and assumptions applied in determining fair value, which include reasonable discount rates, growth rates, market risk premiums and other assumptions about the economic environment. 
Equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Equity method investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary. The Company may estimate the fair value of its equity method investments by considering recent investee equity transactions, DCF analysis, recent operating results, comparable public company operating cash flow multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values. If the fair value of the investment has dropped below its carrying amount, management considers several factors when determining whether an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, such as the length of the time and the extent to which the estimated fair value or market value has been below the carrying value, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the investee, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and general market conditions. The estimation of fair value and whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred requires the application of significant judgment and future results may vary from current assumptions. If declines in the value of the equity method investments are determined to be other-than-temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period as a component of loss from equity investees, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
