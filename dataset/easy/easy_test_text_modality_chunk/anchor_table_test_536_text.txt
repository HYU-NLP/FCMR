ENERGY TRANSFER LP report:
Asset Retirement Obligations . We have determined that we are obligated by contractual or regulatory requirements to remove facilities or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain assets. The fair value of any ARO is determined based on estimates and assumptions related to retirement costs, which the Partnership bases on historical retirement costs, future inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. These fair value assessments are considered to be Level 3 measurements, as they are based on both observable and unobservable inputs. Changes in the liability are recorded for the passage of time (accretion) or for revisions to cash flows originally estimated to settle the ARO. 
An ARO is required to be recorded when a legal obligation to retire an asset exists and such obligation can be reasonably estimated. We will record an ARO in the periods in which management can reasonably estimate the settlement dates. 
Except for certain amounts discussed below, management was not able to reasonably measure the fair value of AROs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , in most cases because the settlement dates were indeterminable. Although a number of other onshore assets in Panhandle’s system are subject to agreements or regulations that give rise to an ARO upon Panhandle’s discontinued use of these assets, AROs were not recorded because these assets have an indeterminate removal or abandonment date given the expected continued use of the assets with proper maintenance or replacement. ETC Sunoco has legal AROs for several other assets at its previously owned refineries, pipelines and terminals, for which it is not possible to estimate when the obligations will be settled. Consequently, the retirement obligations for these assets cannot be measured at this time. At the end of the useful life of these underlying assets, ETC Sunoco is legally or contractually required to abandon in place or remove the asset. We believe we may have additional AROs related to ETC Sunoco’s pipeline assets and storage tanks, for which it is not possible to estimate whether or when the AROs will be settled. Consequently, these AROs cannot be measured at this time. Sunoco LP has AROs related to the estimated future cost to remove underground storage tanks.

ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
Gross operating margin from our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal and Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased a combined $52.9 million year-to-year primarily due to higher volumes. Ethane loading volumes at our Morgan’s Point Ethane Export Terminal, which was placed into service in September 2016, increased 75 MBPD year-to-year. In addition, transportation volumes on our Houston Ship Channel Pipeline System increased 105 MBPD year-to-year primarily due to shipments of ethane from Mont Belvieu to the Morgan’s Point export terminal. 
Gross operating margin from our underground storage facility at the Mont Belvieu hub for NGLs and related products increased $50.7 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average storage fees in 2017. 
Gross operating margin from our Seminole, Chaparral and affiliated NGL pipelines increased a combined net $23.1 million year-to-year primarily due to higher average transportation fees, which accounted for a $15.9 million increase, and higher transportation volumes, which accounted for an additional $14.8 million increase, partially offset by higher operating costs of $6.6 million. On a combined basis, NGL transportation volumes on these pipelines increased 33 MBPD primarily due to increased production from natural gas processing plants located in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountains.
