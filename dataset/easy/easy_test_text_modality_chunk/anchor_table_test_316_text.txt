 • The Texas Express Pipeline extends from Skellytown, Texas to our NGL fractionation and storage complex located in and near Mont Belvieu. Mixed NGLs from production fields located in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin and Mid-Continent regions are delivered to the Texas Express Pipeline via an interconnect with our Mid-America Pipeline System near Skellytown. In addition, the Texas Express Pipeline transports mixed NGLs gathered by the Texas Express Gathering System. Also, mixed NGLs originating from the Denver-Julesburg (“DJ”) Basin in Colorado are transported to the Texas Express Pipeline using the Front Range Pipeline. Our 35% ownership interest in the Texas Express Pipeline is held indirectly through our equity method investment in Texas Express Pipeline LLC.
In 2018, we initiated expansion projects to increase transportation capacity on the Texas Express Pipeline and the Front Range Pipeline by 90 MBPD and 100 MBPD, respectively. The expansions, which are expected to be completed and placed into service in the second quarter of 2020, are designed to facilitate growing production of NGLs from domestic shale basins, including the DJ Basin, by providing producers with flow assurance and greater access to Gulf Coast markets.

Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. 
The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period to operating expense.
