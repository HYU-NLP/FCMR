COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP report:
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 3 , 4 , and 5 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: 
The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.

ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
We own and operate marine terminals (export and import) that handle NGLs. The results of operations from our NGL marine terminals, all of which are located on the Houston Ship Channel, are primarily dependent upon the level of volumes handled (loading and unloading) and the associated fees we charge for such services.
 • The Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (“EHT”) provides terminaling services to exporters, marketers, distributors, chemical companies and major integrated oil companies. EHT has extensive waterfront access consisting of eight deep-water ship docks and a barge dock. The terminal can accommodate vessels with up to a 45 foot draft, including Suezmax tankers, which are the largest tankers that can navigate the Houston Ship Channel. We believe that our location on the Houston Ship Channel enables us to handle larger vessels than our competitors because our waterfront has fewer draft and beam (width) restrictions. The size and structure of our waterfront allows us to receive and unload products for our customers and provide terminaling services.
EHT can load refrigerated cargoes of low-ethane propane and/or butane (collectively referred to as LPG) onto multiple tanker vessels simultaneously. Our LPG export services continue to benefit from increased NGL supplies produced from domestic shale plays, international demand for propane as a feedstock in ethylene and propylene production, and for power generation and heating purposes. The current estimated maximum loading capacity for LPG at EHT is approximately 835 MBPD. EHT has the capability to load up to six Very Large Gas Carrier (“VLGC”) vessels simultaneously, while maintaining the option to switch between loading propane and butane. EHT can load a single VLGC in less than 24 hours, creating greater efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. LPG loading volumes at EHT averaged 555 MBPD, 501 MBPD and 588 MBPD during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
