ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
• The Aegis Ethane Pipeline (“Aegis”) delivers purity ethane to petrochemical facilities located along the southeast Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. Aegis, when combined with a portion of our South Texas NGL Pipeline System, forms an ethane header system stretching from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Mississippi River in Louisiana.
 • The Panola Pipeline transports mixed NGLs from injection points near Carthage, Texas to Chambers County, Texas and supports the Haynesville and Cotton Valley crude oil and natural gas production areas.
Our NGL fractionators separate mixed NGLs into purity NGL products for third-party customers and our NGL marketing activities. Mixed NGLs extracted by domestic natural gas processing facilities represent the largest source of volumes processed at our NGL fractionators. Based upon industry data, we believe that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs, especially those originating from natural gas processing facilities located in West Texas, will be available for fractionation for the foreseeable future.
