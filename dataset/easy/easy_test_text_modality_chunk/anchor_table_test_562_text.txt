MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the indefinite-life intangible asset impairment assessment, including controls over the determination of the fair values of certain of the Company’s indefinite-life intangible assets as part of the annual impairment assessment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods; testing the 
completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation methods; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to estimates of future sales and earnings growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the indefinite-life intangible assets, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s valuation methods and the royalty rates and discount rates significant assumptions.
