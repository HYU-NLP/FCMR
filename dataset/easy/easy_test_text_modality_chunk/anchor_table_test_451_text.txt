ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
The specific, identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business depend largely upon the nature of its operations and include items such as customer relationships and contracts. The method used to value such assets depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the asset and the economic returns the asset is expected to generate. 
Customer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to commercial relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. In certain instances, the acquisition of these intangible assets provides us with access to customers in a defined resource basin and is analogous to having a franchise in a particular area. Efficient operation of the acquired assets (e.g., a natural gas gathering system) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing producers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones within our existing asset footprint. The duration of this type of customer relationship is limited by the estimated economic life of the associated resource basin that supports the customer group. When estimating the economic life of a resource basin, we consider a number of factors, including reserve estimates and the economic viability of production and exploration activities. 
In other situations, the acquisition of a customer relationship intangible asset provides us with access to customers whose hydrocarbon volumes are not attributable to specific resource basins. As with basin-specific customer relationships, efficient operation of the associated assets (e.g., a marine terminal that handles volumes originating from multiple sources) helps to support the commercial relationships with existing customers and provides us with opportunities to establish new ones. The duration of this type of customer relationship is typically limited to the term of the underlying service contracts, including assumed renewals.

Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion through operating (loss) income below is on a pro-forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenues, and selling, general and administrative expenses are substantially attributable to the Merger. The percent changes of line items below operating (loss) income in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in U.S. dollars. 
Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites), and sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, the stage of development of television markets, and the popularity of FTA television. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital platforms on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.

MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
Segment operating income increased $188 million ( 36.6% ), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and favorable volume/mix. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, unfavorable currency and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year property insurance recovery). 
Net revenues decreased $150 million ( 1.5% ), due to unfavorable currency (5.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (3.7 pp), as net pricing was flat. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Turkish lira and Swedish krona. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains across all categories except gum. Net pricing was flat as higher net pricing in gum and candy was offset by lower net pricing in all other categories. 
Segment operating income decreased $2 million ( 0.1% ), primarily due to unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs and lower intangible asset impairment charges.
