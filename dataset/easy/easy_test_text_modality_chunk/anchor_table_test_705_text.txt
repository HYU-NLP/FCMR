SALESFORCE INC report:
service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. 
Since the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft, subscription and support revenues also includes software licenses. These licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Customers purchase these licenses through a subscription. Revenues from distinct licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where the Company allocates revenue to software updates and support, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, such revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. 
The Company typically invoices its customers annually. Typical payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.

ENERGY TRANSFER LP report:
Adjusted EBITDA ( consolidated ). For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA increased 24%, primarily due to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. The most significant impacts from the storm were recognized in our intrastate transportation and storage segment, where realized storage margin increased by $1.5 billion compared to the prior period as a result of withdrawals during the storm. In addition, realized natural gas sales increased $950 million and retained fuel revenues increased $132 million in our intrastate transportation and storage segment, and these increases were also primarily due to the impacts of the storm. 
The change in Adjusted EBITDA also reflected the impacts of non-storm-related factors among all of the Partnership’s reportable segments. In our crude oil transportation and services segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $235 million primarily due to lower average tariff rates realized on our Texas crude pipeline system, as well as a decrease from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business. In our interstate transportation and storage segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 
$165 million primarily due to shipper contract expirations and a recent shipper bankruptcy. In our midstream segment, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $198 million primarily due to favorable NGL and natural gas prices.
