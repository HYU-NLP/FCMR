(1) Settlement losses of $ 3 million in 2020, $ 5 million in 2019 and $ 5 million in 2018 were incurred in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program. See Note 8, Restructuring Program , for more information. Net settlement losses of $ 13 million for our U.S. plans and settlement losses of $ 6 million for our non-U.S. plans in 2020, settlement losses of $ 12 million for our U.S. plans and settlement gains of $ 4 million for our non-U.S. plans in 2019 and settlement losses of $ 31 million for our U.S. plans and $ 4 million for our non-U.S. plans in 2018 related to lump-sum payment elections made by retired employees. 
For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated market return value that recognizes the cost over a four-year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.

WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
Our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent. Prior to the sale of the Education Business in 2018 , we competed with other providers of curriculum-based products and services to schools. 
We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance. We have also made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and DTC offerings and consider these platforms to be one of our intellectual property assets. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and Internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective. 
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content, in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. We use external vendors to detect and remove infringing content and leverage our membership in a range of industry groups to address piracy issues.
