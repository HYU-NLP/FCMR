ENTERPRISE PRODCT PARTNRS LP report:
Our natural gas gathering pipelines gather, treat and transport natural gas from production developments to regional natural gas plants for further processing. Our natural gas transmission pipelines transport natural gas from regional processing facilities to downstream electric generation plants, local gas distribution companies, industrial and municipal customers, storage facilities or other connecting pipelines.
The results of operations from our natural gas pipelines and related storage assets are primarily dependent upon the volume of natural gas gathered, treated, transported or stored, the level of firm capacity reservations made by shippers, and the fees associated with each activity. Transportation fees charged to shippers are based on either tariffs regulated by governmental agencies, including the FERC, or contractual arrangements. See “Regulatory Matters” within this Part I, Items 1 and 2 for information regarding governmental oversight of our natural gas pipelines.
We proportionately consolidate our undivided interests, which range from 22% to 80%, in 1,471 miles of the Texas Intrastate System. The Texas Intrastate System also includes our Wilson natural gas storage facility, which consists of a network of leased and owned underground salt dome storage caverns located in Wharton County, Texas with an aggregate 12.9 Bcf of usable storage capacity. Four of these caverns, comprising 6.9 Bcf of usable capacity, are held under an operating lease. The remainder of our Texas Intrastate System is wholly owned.
