ALLSTATE CORP report:
Traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Voluntary accident and health insurance products are expected to remain in force for an extended period and therefore are primarily classified as long-duration contracts. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Benefits are reflected in contract benefits and recognized over the life of the policy in relation to premiums. 
Immediate annuities with life contingencies, including certain structured settlement annuities, provide benefits over a period that extends beyond the period during which premiums are collected. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when received at the inception of the contract. Benefits are recognized in relation to premiums with the establishment of a reserve. The change in reserve over time is recorded in contract benefits and primarily relates to accumulation at the discount rate and annuitant mortality. Profits from these policies come primarily from investment income, which is recognized over the life of the contract. 
Interest-sensitive life contracts, such as universal life and single premium life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and contract charges assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. These contract charges are recognized as revenue when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Contract benefits include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance.
