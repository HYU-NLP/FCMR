ENERGY TRANSFER LP report:
• The Midcontinent Systems are located in three large natural gas producing regions in the United States: the Hugoton Basin in southwest Kansas, the Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, including the STACK and SCOOP plays, and the Arkoma Basin in Eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas. These mature basins have continued to provide generally long-lived, predictable production volumes. Our Midcontinent assets are extensive systems that gather, compress and dehydrate low-pressure gas. The Midcontinent Systems include 24 natural gas processing facilities (Mocane, Beaver, Antelope Hills, Woodall, Wheeler, Sunray, Hemphill, Hamlin, Spearman, Crescent, Rose Valley, Hopeton, Bradley, Bradley II, McClure, Wheeler, South Canadian, Clinton, Roger Mills, Canute, Cox City, Thomas, Calumet and Wetumka) with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3.1 Bcf/d. 
• We operate our Midcontinent Systems at low pressures to maximize the total throughput volumes from the connected wells. Wellhead pressures are therefore adequate to allow for flow of natural gas into the gathering lines without the cost of wellhead compression. 
• In September 2022, we acquired Woodford Express, LLC, which has cryogenic gas processing and treatment capacity of 450 MMcf/d and over 200 miles of gathering lines that are connected to Energy Transfer’s pipeline network.
