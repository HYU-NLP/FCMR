BOEING CO report:
The subjectivity of the liability associated with providing consideration to customers resulting from the 737 MAX Grounding and the complexity of assessing the outcome of the ongoing litigation and investigations related to the 737 MAX required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort. 
We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of regulatory approval for return to service in various jurisdictions and the status of consideration discussions with individual customers. 
We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, including the timing and conditions of 737 MAX return to service, and, where possible, we corroborated the assumptions with management outside of the accounting and finance organizations.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP report:
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of August 28, 2022, were $1,364 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations. 
We identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models.
