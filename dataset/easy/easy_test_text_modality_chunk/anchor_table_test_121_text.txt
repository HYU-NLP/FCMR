The fair values of the commodity-related financial positions have been determined using independent third-party prices, readily available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. Non-trading positions offset physical exposures to the cash market; none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above tables. Price-risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming a theoretical 10% change (increase or decrease) in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the 
contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price. Results are presented in absolute terms and represent a potential gain or loss in net income or in other comprehensive income. In the event of an actual 10% change in prompt month natural gas prices, the fair value of our total derivative portfolio may not change by 10% due to factors such as when the financial instrument settles and the location to which the financial instrument is tied (i.e., basis swaps) and the relationship between prompt month and forward months.

MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC report:
Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily include customer advance payments typically collected a few days before product delivery, at which time deferred revenues are reclassified and recorded as net revenues. We generally do not receive non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year. 
We promote our products with marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, advertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1,670 million in 2022, $ 1,564 million in 2021 and $ 1,376 million in 2020. We 
expense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $ 346 million in 2022, $ 347 million in 2021 and $ 332 million in 2020. We record marketing and advertising as well as research and development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.

WARNER BROS DISCOVERY INC report:
As described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the Europe reporting unit was $1.9 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 or earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that they may not recover the carrying value of the asset. Management concluded that the continued impacts of COVID-19 on the operating results of the Europe reporting unit represented a triggering event in the second quarter of 2020. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. Management performed quantitative goodwill impairment analyses during the second and fourth quarters of 2020 for the Europe reporting unit using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model. Significant judgments and assumptions by management in the DCF model specific to the Europe reporting unit included the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill quantitative impairment assessments for the Europe reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill quantitative impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value measurements of the Europe reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates and long-term growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discount rates and long-term growth rates.
